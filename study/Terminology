Terminology


- Cardinality
: The number of unique value.
  e.g., Sex: Female, Male ==> Cardinality : 2
  Id number ==> Cardinality : the number of record in the table
  
  ** Query in Oracle 
     select count(distinct(deprno)) from employee;
     
- Selectivity
: The number that how they can select feature value well in the dataset. 
  e.g., When the selectivity is 1, every value is unique
  If we use column that has high selectivity as index, the efficiency will be high, vice versa.
  
  ** Query in Oracle
     SELECT (distinct_keys / num_rows) AS Selectivity
     FROM dba_indexes -- dab_indexes is given by Oracle catalog view
     WHERE index_name like 'index_name' and Owner = 'Table_Owner';
     
  * How to increase index's selectivity? 
    ==> Join more than two columns and use it as index (High cardinality, High Selectivity, but Low Space efficiency)
